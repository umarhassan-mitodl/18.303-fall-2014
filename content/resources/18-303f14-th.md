Colors of A-1 where A is a discretized ∇2 with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Top: several columns in 1d (Ω = [0,L] = [0,1]). Bottom: two columns in 2d (Ω = [1,-1] x [-1,1]. In both 1d and 2d, the location of minimum corresponds to the index of the column: this is the effect of the unit-vector "source" or "force" = 1 at that position (and = 0 elsewhere).
